[00:01.62] もう一回
[00:04.46] 息を吸って
[00:07.90] 吹き返してみよう
[00:11.90] 
[00:14.79] もう一回
[00:17.65] 息を吐いて
[00:20.98] 闇を抜け出そう
[00:24.48] 
[00:54.39] 「叶いそうも無い」
[00:56.65] 夢はもう見るなと
[00:59.34] 僕は眠らされた
[01:02.84] 
[01:05.05] それでもきっと
[01:07.94] 夜には目が覚め
[01:10.24] 追いかけてしまうだろう
[01:15.74] 
[01:15.98] Let's all believe
[01:18.54] We're crystals on leaves
[01:21.32] Evaporate into the sky
[01:32.32] 
[01:26.87] Sometimes it's good
[01:29.52] Sometimes it's bad
[01:32.22] されど 我が人生
[01:36.22] 
[01:37.44] Hello Hello Hello
[01:45.56] New Wall
[01:48.67] Hello Hello Hello
[01:56.29] New Wall
[02:00.29] 
[01:59.78] 敵いそうも無い
[02:03.28] 
[02:02.32] 「壁」が立ちはだかって
[02:04.82] 僕の傷を望むだろう
[02:09.32] 
[02:10.19] それでもきっと
[02:13.29] どうしようもないくらい
[02:15.20] 僕はそれを愛するだろう
[02:20.70] 
[02:21.20] Let's all believe
[02:24.06] We're crystals on leaves
[02:26.63] Evaporate into the sky
[02:37.63] 
[02:32.47] Sometimes it's good
[02:35.02] Sometimes it's bad
[02:37.85] 愛しい 我が人生
[02:41.85] 
[02:43.15] Hello Hello Hello
[02:50.98] New Wall
[02:54.27] Hello Hello Hello
[03:02.76] New Wall
[03:06.76] 
[03:05.77] Stumbled down
[03:06.56] and u fell on the ground
[03:08.32] but just follow the sound
[03:10.01] so that you'll be found
[03:11.65] Well go on
[03:16.65] 
[03:18.14] Stumbled down
[03:19.68] and u fell on the ground
[03:20.85] but don't turn around
[03:22.49] now go find your crown
[03:23.92] Well go on
